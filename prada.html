				<li>Architect: Herzog and de Meuron</li>
				<li>Year: 2003</li>
		</ul>
		<p id="blurb1">This geometric glass building built by Herzog and de Meuron<br>
										is probably one of the most well known architecture I visited<br>
										on the trip. It's a 6-story concept store built for Prada.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb2">Despite the outshell being made of glass, the convex bubbles<br>
			 							makes the building look soft and cushion-like. The transparent<br>
										facade lets light in but also allows the visitors to see the<br>
										view of Tokyo as a backdrop for the merchandises.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb3">Sadly I did not go into the building since it was closed.<br>
										But it was still cool to look at if from afar. Although it<br>
										is very different from the buildings surrounding it, it some how<br>
										looks comfortable nestled in between the trees and residential<br>
										houses.
