		<p id="blurb1">After another 5min walk, you will see two very distinct <br>
									buildings across the street. The glass building with white<br>
									crisscrossing patterns is by the famous architect, Toyo Ito.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb2">The white concrete braces micmics the criscrossing branches<br>
										of the trees lining the streets of Omotesando. The light <br>
										shines through the gaps in between, creating a really <br>
										interesting visual expereince from the inside.
		</p>
		<p id="blurb3"> I encrouage you to step into the buildings! Even though<br>
										I wasn't going to buy anything, I still went in becuase<br>
										I did not want to pass off the opportunity to look at the<br>
										building from the inside. I didn't go to the very top floor, <br>
										but I heard there's a terrace roof garden there.<br>
