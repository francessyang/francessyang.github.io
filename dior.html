		<p id="blurb1">First stop on our architecture stroll (tokyo edition) <br>
										we have Dior Omotesando store by SANAA,a Toyko based  <br>
										architecture firm. The firm is known for its clean & shiny <br>
										modernist designs with lots of glass facades and marble.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb2">The building itself isn't that noticiable actually.<br>
										I was walking on the other side if the streets and there<br>
										were trees blocking my view of the building.<br>
										The plaid pattern on the facade was probably an add on<br>
										to go along with their new collection, but to me, that was<br>
										the most eye catching part of the architecture.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb3"> I recommend visiting there at night, because<br>
										I heard it is more beautiful when the building<br>
										lights up with different intensities on each floor.<br>
										That's when you can really see the trasparency of the glass<br>
										and the translucent wavy acrylic screen that adds to the texture.<br>
