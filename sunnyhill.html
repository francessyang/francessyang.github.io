		<p id="blurb1">I saved the best for last! SunnyHills Minami Aoyama Store <br>
										is my favourite building I visited that day. Not only becuase<br>
										it houses a Taiwanses brand, I had the best overall expereince <br>
										visiting this location.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb2">
										It is built by yet another famous Japanese Architect, Kengo Kuma.<br>
										The distinct complex structure and the use of wood really stays<br>
										true to Kuma's style. When the light shines through beautifully<br>
										through the gaps of the "branches." Everything is cohesive; <br>
										 the furniture mimics the same style of the exterior.<br>
		</p>
		<p id="blurb3"> When I first walked in, the friendly staff greeted me and asked <br>
										if I wanted to try any of the pinapple cakes. I was so confused <br>
										when they led me and my sister up to the second floor. They <br>
										sat us down at a table and gave us each a pineapple cake and a <br>
										warm cup of taiwanese mountain tea. And it was all free! We had <br>
										a really good time just enjoying the treats and admiring<br>
										 the architecture.<br>
