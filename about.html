		<p id="blurb1">Hi! My name is Frances. I'm an Junior studying Architecture at UC Berkeley.
									I travelled to Japan this past summer with my sister. We wanted to do
									something different besides visiting the Tokyo Tower and draining my wallet
									on things we probably don't need, so I did a little research and planned out a route
									to visit some of the interesting architecture that Tokyo has to offer.
		</p>
		<p id="blurb2"> This is a little interactive map for you to come along with me as I reminisce
									my time strolling through the streets of Tokyo, admiring all the beautiful architecture.
